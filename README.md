# Project Overview

### Hardware

- **Development board, RuuviTag Pro sensor with accessories, and Web UI**<br>
![system_image](docs/system_image.png)

### Main Components

- **Main Logic** (`main`): Central logic that manages the devices workflow.
- **Storage** (`storage`): Handles persistent storage operations for sensor data and log messages.
- **Sensors** (`sensors`): Manages Bluetooth sensors, their initialization, scanning, and data collection.
- **GSM Modem** (`gsm_modem`): Controls the GSM modem for cellular network connectivity.
- **Discord API** (`discord_api`): Provides integration with Discord for sending notifications and logs.
- **Firebase API** (`firebase_api`): Handles communication with Firebase for data storage retrieval.
- **Power Management** (`power_management`): Configures power management settings for the ESP32.
- **JSON Helper** (`json_helper`): Converts sensor data into JSON format for storage and transmission.
- **Reporter** (`reporter`): Used in logs reporting, including battery status.
- **System States** (`system_states`): Defines and manages the system state machine for recovery and normal operations.
- **Time Manager** (`time_manager`): Manages system time, synchronization, and timezone settings.

### Workflow

- **Initialization**: The system initializes power management, storage, sensors and the GSM modem.
- **Data collection**: The RuuviTag sensor data is collected via BLE and stored in SPIFFS.
- **Data transmission**: After a certain number of boot cycles (`SEND_DATA_CYCLE`), the accumulated data is sent to Firebase via the GSM module.
- **Error handling**: If an error occurs (e.g., GSM initialization fails), the system logs the error and restarts.
- **Sleep mode**: The ESP32 enters deep sleep mode after each cycle to save power.

# Working logic

1. **Boot process**:
- The system checks the boot count and system state from NVS.
- If it's the first boot, it initializes the GSM modem and sends a startup message to Discord
- If it's a normal boot, it proceeds with data collection and transmission

2. **Data collection**:
- The RuuviTag sensor data is collected via BLE and stored in a JSON file in SPIFFS
- The system waits up to 10 seconds to receive sensor data.

3. **Data transmission**:
- After `SEND_DATA_CYCLE` boot cycles, the system sends the accumulated data to Firebase Cloud Firestore.
- If the transmission fails, it retries up to 3 times.

4. **Sleep mode**:
- After completing the cycle, the ESP32 enter deep sleep for `TIME_TO_SLEEP` seconds.
